# Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. Built with React and Vite, it showcases my skills, projects, and professional background. The site features dynamic animations, including a custom gradient background effect using anime.js, and SVG icons for visual appeal. The portfolio is designed to be responsive and provides an engaging user experience with smooth transitions and interactive elements.
